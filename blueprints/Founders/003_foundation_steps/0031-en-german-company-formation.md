## Forming a capital company in Germany

   There are always specifics, but forming a company in Germany - including costs - typically involves:  
   
   - **Gewerbeamt:** Register your business (Gewerbeeintragung) and cancel any old business registrations if needed.  
   - **Handelsregister (HRB):** Register your capital company (e.g., GmbH or UG (haftungsbeschr√§nkt)) through a notary.  
   - **Finanzamt:** Register for tax purposes, including obtaining a VAT identification number (Umsatzsteueridentifizierungsnummer).  
   - **IHK Membership:** Join the local Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK).  
   - **Contract Adjustments:** Update existing contracts and add necessary services (CEX) for the company.
