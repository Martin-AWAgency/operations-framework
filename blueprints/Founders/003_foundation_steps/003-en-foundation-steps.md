# Foundation Steps

This section offers a basic overview of forming a company in Europe.  
Web3 ventures may add extra elements like blockchain or decentralization,  
but the main steps are similar to those for traditional companies.

1. **Do I need to form a company?**  
   Forming a company gives you legal protection and a clear structure.  
   It builds trust with investors and partners and separates your personal and business liabilities.  
   Consider your goals to decide if incorporation is the right move.

2. **What are the steps to form a company?**  
   In general, the process in Europe includes:  
   - **Choosing a legal structure:** Decide on the type of company (e.g., GmbH, SARL, or other forms).  
   - **Business registration:** Register your business with the local authority.  
   - **Tax registration:** Register with the tax office and obtain necessary tax IDs, such as a VAT number.  
   - **Additional memberships:** Join any required local or regional chambers (like a chamber of commerce).  
   - **Final adjustments:** Update contracts and integrate any needed platforms or services for your business.

   While these steps serve as a good guide, the specific requirements can vary by country.

3. **Legal implications and protections of forming a company:**  
   Other than operating as a sole proprietorship, incorporating as a capital company protects your personal assets from business liabilities.  
   This structure builds confidence with investors by showing your commitment to compliance with European laws.  
   Even for Web3 ventures, traditional legal rules—with additional regulations—apply, so it’s important to understand these early.

4. **Comparing bootstrapping versus seeking funding:**  
   The basics are the same whether you bootstrap or seek external funding:  
   - **Bootstrapping:** Build your company using personal funds or early revenue. This approach gives you more control but may slow growth.  
   - **Seeking funding:** Raise money from investors, banks, or alternative channels such as token sales and community funding—especially relevant in the Web3 space.  
     This is where strong legal compliance and a deep understanding of new regulations, such as MiCA and possibly the AI Act, become crucial.  
   A clear business plan and strong financial projections are essential in either case.

5. **Building the foundation: Solo, Team, or Community-driven?**  
   Choose a model that fits your vision and resources:  
   - **Solo:** Working alone offers simplicity and agility but may limit your skill set.  
   - **Team:** A dedicated team brings diverse skills and shared responsibilities.  
   - **Community-driven:** Common in Web3, this model leverages decentralized input and broad support.  
   Regardless of the model, thorough planning, market research, and risk assessment are essential.
