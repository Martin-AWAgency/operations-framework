#### Wallet Change Request: 



Dear Catalyst Team, we are requesting a change of our receiving address.

The previous wallet included Ricardo and Mauro as signers, who have not been actively participating in the European Cardano Community's endeavors since late Fund 10. While Ricardo honorably attempted to maintain activities, waiting for his signature often caused delays.

When Davide, Deryck, and Marcus formed the new core team, we agreed to create a new multisignature wallet. However, with only Davide and Marcus remaining on the core team, we decided to make Marcus the treasurer of the current single-signature wallet.

At the time of this writing, we have already begun migrating the assets to the new wallet and have executed our first community-beneficial transaction using it.



Please update the receiving address from
