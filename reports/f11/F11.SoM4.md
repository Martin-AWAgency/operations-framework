- Analysis and finalization of current Blueprints
- Planning and execution of giveaways (merch + NFT)

Please note: 

The milestone tool did not allow for a proper matching of the updated months according to the CR.

While this Milestone would now end in Apr 2025 we took the latest reasonable option possible: Aug 24
