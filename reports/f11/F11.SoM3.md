### **Milestone Outputs**

- X (formerly Twitter)-Spaces held and recorded
- Extending content of Founders' Blueprint
- Planning and execution of giveaways (merch + NFT)
- KPI tracking file and goals until End of Milestone

Please note: 

The milestone tool did not allow for a proper matching of the updated months according to the CR.

While this Milestone would now end in Mar 2025 we took the latest reasonable option possible: Jul 24
