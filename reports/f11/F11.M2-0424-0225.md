# F11 - 04/2024 - 02/2025 Milestone 2


### Summary

To ensure accuracy and relevance, we delayed our submission to align with the latest data and developments.

Interest and participation in the Country Hub workshops continued to be lower than expected.  
However, those hosts who held ECC workshops, returned to strengthen and grow their European communities. To alleviate production and shipping constraints, we have preemptively ordered all merchandise.  

We see additional workshop bookings in our roadmap and introduced a recurring Pitch Fest event starting November 17th. This initiative aims to support projects in their pitch training while extending their exposure into the community.   

Marcus launched the NFTweekend as part of our regular weekly giveaways in May. In collaboration with Deryck, he integrated CNFT projects to offer promotional NFTs, revitalizing growth across our X profile and Discord channel. Deryck, being deeply rooted in the NFT community took over from September onwards. Onboarding of projects happened through our Fireside Chats and through direct messaging.

Davide has been instrumental in leading hosts on XSpaces and representing ECC at live events, significantly bolstering the connections between the Greek and Italian communities.  

A highlight was our African Special Fireside Chat. Initiated by Marcus, the intention was to gain real insights for founders building technical solutions for the African market . The event was initially led by Boaz (Congo) and was spontaneously enriched by additional experience from Emmanuel (Nigeria). 
This event led to the proposal for creating Blueprints for founders engaging with the African market (Proposal Fund 13 - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/cardano/idea/130756).  

We also resumed German XSpaces, in collaboration with Markus, a savvy project manager, former auditor, and long-standing community member.   

Our extension beyond the initial timeline has provided additional time to fulfill tasks, deliver extra value to the community, and stay within our budget constraints.

While remaining on track and committed to our proposal, we as a team lowered our expected work-reward ratio until we fully understood the current situation. We trust that the change request (link attached) set for the upcoming milestones will completely release our constraints.


### Constraints

Market conditions and low participation have impacted the teamâ€™s mental health, influencing both this project and their individual projects. This led to delays in communication and execution, which in turn slowed down signups and engagement.  

Unfortunately, the continuation of the NFTweekend was not carried out as promised during the handover. Despite extended grace periods and active support from its original initiator, the new responsible parties did not reliably deliver postings or announce winners. This inconsistency significantly disrupted the otherwise steady performance of our social media efforts.  

We perceived our proposition as unique within the European ecosystem and underestimated the unintended competition from workshops/events funded by intersectMBO (iM) and the Cardano Foundation (CF).   
The benefits provided for hosting events by iM and CF are more attractive than ours, offering higher rewards that better align with hosts' perceived opportunities for growth in the ecosystem. We acknowledge that competing with iM or CF was not our initial intention, as our core value lies in being a hub for founders.  

We have learned from these constraints and are shifting our focus to elements within our control, such as enabling projects to gain more exposure and providing founders with direct support from experienced and caring community members. However, we were also supporting OdyC Dao (Greek community) to kick-start their live events as a foundation for their Euphoria proposal.   

We kindly request consideration of the change request for the upcoming milestones as a proactive measure to alleviate the current constraints. Bearing in mind our proactive management of the reward-ratio, we suggested granting some flexibility regarding the target of hosting in only 3 of the 5 countries.
