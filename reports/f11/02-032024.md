# F11 - 2024 Milestone 1


### Summary

Our first milestone was branded by crisis management to get the funded proposal up and running, despite major constraints.  

Marcus took the lead as interim for Ricardo, and managed to recover the almost lost funding and to get the project back on track with an adapted schedule. 

We extended our initial timeline from the proposal and thus gained additional time to complete the tasks, bring additional value to the community while staying within the proposed budget.  

In conclusion, this means we as team are lowering our expected work-reward ratio, but remain on track and committed to our proposal.  

We are propelling further to create an open sourced and project focused community within Cardano.  


### Constraints

We started with less active team members than initially expected, and almost lost the funding due to some administrative constraints.  

This is because Ricardo (official project lead) and Mauro (Catalyst PR) are receiving a higher workload from their day jobs, or other involvements.  

With that Davide and Marcus are shouldering the additional packages to cover up for the promised workload.  

In parts both have to rebuild the trust-connection of Ricardo's and Mauro's contacts. Some of these connections already dissolved prior or at first contact.  

Either because the counterparty did not respond or because the counterparty's own projects had to search for new opportunities outside the Cardano ecosystem.  

Because of these time constraints we have moved the merch and design opportunities into April and currently are discussing quotes with partners that also have approached us proactively.  

We have shifted the priorities to organize hosts for the country hubs. Reason for this is, that we believe the distribution of merch will be much easier to accomplish than getting hosts ready to participate. During Milestone 2 in April, we have created a budgeting plan for the workshop merch and are working on the design in Milestone 2 as well.

We kindly ask to distribute the full completion of this PoA to the second milestone with a potential overflow into the third. Reasoning for overflow into third milestone are development time and the activities around Fund12. We want to utilize some of the attention campaigns from projects to foster the distribution of merch.
